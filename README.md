## 🔍 About the Project
Image segmentation is a critical step in image analysis, allowing you to partition an image into meaningful regions. This project includes:
1. **Pixel Clustering with K-Means** for segmenting images based on pixel intensities.
2. **Edge Detection** using Gaussian blur and the Canny algorithm.
3. **Foreground Extraction** leveraging thresholding and morphological operations.

---

## ✨ Features
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segment images into clusters based on pixel similarity.
- **Edge Detection**: Highlight the edges in images for further analysis.
- **Foreground Extraction**: Isolate significant regions from the background using morphological transformations.
- **Visualization**: Display segmented images and edge-detected outputs using Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    Open the notebook and follow the cells to process an image.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Image_Segmentation_by_Clustering_pixels.ipynb
    ```

2. **Functions Overview**:
    - `load_and_preprocess_image`: Load and resize an image for clustering.
    - `kmeans_clustering`: Apply K-Means for pixel segmentation.
    - `load_image_grayscale`: Load an image in grayscale for edge detection.
    - `apply_canny_edge_detection`: Perform edge detection on preprocessed images.
    - `foreground_extraction`: Extract key objects using thresholding and morphological operations.

3. **Sample Input**:
    Provide the path to an image file as input in the appropriate cell.

## 📊 Results

### K-Means Segmentation
- Images are segmented into regions based on color intensities.
- Example: Clustered images showing segmentation into multiple classes.

### Edge Detection
- Clear edge maps are generated to highlight boundaries.

### Foreground Extraction
- The primary object in the image is isolated for further processing.
